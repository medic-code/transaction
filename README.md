Personal Transaction Tracker

Problem:
Each month its a slow process to work through all transactions in the preceeding month using the personal banking transaction data, most modern apps that try to automate this process are too bulky in UI and don't provide the simple analysis that I want to see on a desktop format.

A bare minimum solution to track ingoings and outgoings on a monthly basis in visual way that is automatic in order to save me time each month tracking my financial status.

5. Display total balance each month
